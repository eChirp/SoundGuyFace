# SoundGuyFace
This is a simple USB audio interface using the Texas Instruments 2912A. The IC is a single chip solution for standard audio needs with a computer. Professional microphones use the XLR connector and have differential signals. The SoundGuyFace takes both, microphone and instrument 1/4" cables. A dedicated gain knob let you choose the input sensitivity.
